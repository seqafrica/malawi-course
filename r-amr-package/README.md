**AMRgen**:

AMRgen is an open-source R package designed to bridge the gap between genotypic and phenotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data. Developed as an extension to the AMR R package, it provides tools to interpret AMR genes, integrate these findings with antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) data, and calculate genotype-phenotype associations.

This package is developed in collaboration with the ESGEM-AMR Working Group and is tailored for researchers and healthcare professionals tackling AMR globally.
