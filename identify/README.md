# Identify Unknown Species

In this exercise you use BLAST, KmerFinder, and PathogenWatch to identify species
from a set of genome assemblies.

Please all pick two isolates, noting that the _odd numbered_ assemblies are high
quality, and the _even numbered_ ones have an issue for you to discover.

The assemblies can be found [here](https://zwets.it/course/malawi/identify).
